# Django Templates.tmbundle

Modifications and additions to the official Python Django Template TextMate bundle originally located at http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Bundles/Python%20Django%20Templates.tmbundle/.

These changes really should extend the official, rather than override them outright.

A lot of these snippets and commands are pilfered from other people's bundles.


# Install

    $ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
